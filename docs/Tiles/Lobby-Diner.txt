Start:   You awaken to find yourself seated in one of the secluded booths of a Diner, wallet, watch, and keys still with you. A quick
	 survey of the Diner shows there to be; two young men surrounding a jukebox. A teenage girl in the booth adjacent to
	 you who seems to have fallen asleep, and the bartender who is beckoning you to him.

Inspect: A plate of half eaten cinnamon toast and bananas with cream sits on the table in front of you. Your seat is sticky
Area	 and smells of soda. You are seated next to a frosted but not opaque window. A teenage girl snores aggressively to
	 your left. Two young men click their fingers slightly out of time to a song playing on the juke box. The bartender
	 seems to have something important to tell you.
